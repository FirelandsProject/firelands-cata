# CREATE A NEW FIRELANDS CORE MODULE

Run the script `create-module.sh`:
- If you're on windows, execute it with Git Bash (right click on it and choose Git bash) if you have installed Git extensions
- If you're on linux, just run it with bash or with ./create-module.sh

This script will create the base of your module, with a clean history and add a git configuration option to this repository only (local config).


NOTE: You can also clone our base-module manually, clean the history, and configure but you should use the script instead https://github.com/FirelandsProject/base-module


3) Share it with the community!

Join us on our discord, share it there, then we might fork it officially and it will appear in the module catalogue.

Note: For Advanced CMake implementations a <ModuleName>.cmake file in your module folder will be included in the config of Modules if it exists. See: ./CMakeList.txt around line #290
